Authentication Log Monitoring with Elastic Stack
Overview
This project focuses on monitoring authentication logs from both Windows and SSH servers deployed on Vultr. Using Elastic Agents and Kibana, I set up real-time log analysis and alerting to detect authentication events, such as successful and failed login attempts, brute-force attempts, and unauthorized access.

Key Features
Log Collection & Ingestion: Configured Elastic Agents to collect authentication logs from Windows Event Viewer and SSH logs.
Centralized Monitoring: Utilized Elasticsearch and Kibana to store, visualize, and analyze authentication events.
Real-time Alerts: Created custom alerts in Kibana to notify about suspicious login activities and potential security threats.
Cloud Deployment: Deployed and managed Windows & Linux-based SSH servers on Vultr for log collection and security analysis.
Technologies Used
Vultr (Cloud Hosting)
Windows Event Viewer & Linux SSH Logs
Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch, Kibana, Elastic Agents)
